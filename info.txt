React Using One-way Databinding.

Every Component in react maintain a state.

What is State?
- Every time you want vairable to be in sync with the ui you need to use state vairable


What is React Hooked?
- Hooked is nothing it's just like a function😂😁
- come some Functionality to create a local state vairable.
- writen by faceBook Developer.


What is useState() Hooked?
- TO Create A state vriable.
- return a array that Why we writen const [vairable] = useState()
- ex. const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("KB");
  - searchText is a local vriable
  - when we change our vairable value using a function that function get int useState(). so setSearchText is 
    a function😂😁
  - "KB" is initial value.
  - return [vairable nm , function to update the vriable]



Monolith Arcitectur
- Everthing in one Project (UI,BACKEND,SERVICES) - (ALL IN ONE) - One Repo
  ex. One App Like JOB BORAD App
      - UI
      - BACKEND API
      - Notification Services
      - Email Services


MicroService Arcitectur
- Everthing in Degferent Repo
  ex - UI is Seprate
     - BACKEND API is Seprate
     - Notification Seprate
     - Authentication Seprate
     - Logs Seprate

- Advantages : 
  - Esay To Test
  - Easit To maintain
  - Sepration Of Councern (Every MicroService have they are OWN worked to do)



- TWO type of routing
  1. Client Side routing
  2. Server Side routing
  


- Props Driling

- Lifting The State UP

-useContect()
  - to manage the props drillng
  - global access

- Create Our Store
=> Redux
   - To manage the global variable in our Store
   - Create A One Store and define a logical sepration it's known as 'slice'
     = > Slice Means  
      - define a data to a One big Continer 
      - Slice is a poration of your store
        - user Sclice
        - Authentication slice
        - cart slice
        - theme slice

   - suppose i have to modify my store directly can't do that , i use DISPACTH and ACTION
 
   -  what is reducer?
     - suppose we deisptach the action and call the reducer fuction that fuction is known as 'reducer' that  update the slice of the my redux store.  

   - How to read the Store?
     - 'selectore' also known as 'subscriber'
     - if you read the store you have to call the selectore. that selectore give you info of store.
